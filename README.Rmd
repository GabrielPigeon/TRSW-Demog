# methods

## Study population
The study was conducted using a nest-box network established in 2004 in southern Québec covering a 10 200 km2 area which is characterized by an east-west gradient of agricultural intensification. We monitored 400 nest-boxes distributed equally among 40 farms spanning this gradient every two days throughout the breeding season (April to August) from 2006 to 2019. Nests were monitored every two days during the breeding season (from early May to mid-July). Females were captured in nest-boxes during incubation and nestling rearing. At first capture, adult females were marked individually with an official aluminium metal ring and classified as second year (SY) or as after second year (ASY) according to plumage coloration following Hussel (REF). Nestlings were marked at 12 days old and genetically sexed [@riouxpaquetteSevereRecentDecrease2014]. ** include range of sample size info **


## Environment

We quantified local environment using several variables: mean temperature ($^{\circ}$C), total precipitation, and days of cold snaps during rearing period (defined as the period from 1st of june to 15th of july), level of agricultural intensification and the level of competition with it's main competitor the house sparrow. Temperature was measured using ibutton (REF) taking a recording at every hour with a resolution of 0.5$^{\circ}$C placed on the underside of one nest boxes on each farms. Precipitation was recorded every 2 days using pluviometers located near a nest box on each farm and summed over the rearing period. Cold snap was defined as the number of days during which the maximum daily temperature measured by the ibutton did not exceed 18.8$^{\circ}$C, a measure which as previously been found to correlate with fledging success in this population(Garret et al. 2021). To quantify the level of agricultural intensification, we used a robust principal component analysis based on the the compositional data.  Compositional data was assesed in situ each year within a radius of 500m around each nest boxes and classified as forest, corn & soybean, forage fields and cereals. We then calculated the mean percent cover of these habitats across the 10 nest boxes on each farm and for each year independently. The first component of the PCA explains 80.34% of the variance in landcover, and has a strong positive correlation with corn and soybean and negative with both forage fields and forest cover (see Garret et al. 2021 for more details). House sparrow competition was defined as the number of nestboxes in which at least 1 house sparrow breeding attempt was made. All environmental variables were standardized to a mean of 0 and sd of 1 prior to analysis. 

## Vital rate estimation

Vital rates were estimated using a multi-state CMR model in order to account for imperfect observation (Lebreton et al., 2009; Kéry & Schaub 2012). We considered 3 states: successfully reproductive, non-successfully reproductive and dead ( reproductive success being defined as having fledged at least 1 offspring). This allowed us to control for the much higher capture probability of females with successful reproduction than those without (Lagrange et al. XXXX). The transitions between these states allowed us to estimate both survival probability from one summer to the next and reproductive success. In addition, the number of fledglings produced was jointly modeled using a zero-inflated poisson model (REF). The model was implemented in nimble (ref). MCMC chains were run for 60000 iterations with a burn-in of 50000 and a thinning of 5. Model convergence was assessed visually and using Gelman and Rubin's convergence diagnostic (Gelman & Rubin, 1992).

### survival and reproductive success

We estimated survival ($S\in (0,1)$) and reproductive success ($R \in (0,1)$) using a hierarchical Bayesian multi-state model (Kéry and Schaub 2012) with 3 states: 1) $R=0$, 2) $R=1$, 3) dead. Transitions between state depended on both the probability to survival and the probability to successfully produce fledgling (table 2). To simplify the model, we assumed that there was no reproductive cost of reproduction ($r$ is the same when transiting from state 1 -> 2 and from 2 -> 2) and no survival cost of reproduction ($s$ is the same for state 1 and 2). Both $s$ and $r$ were modeled as a function of age (3 age classes: nestling, second year and after second year). Individual heterogeneity in reproductive performance was accounted for using a random effects of individual while un-explained annual variation in both reproductive performance and survival was accounted for using year as a random effect. Such that: 

$$
logit(s_{i,t})= A_{a_{i,t}}^{s} + E_{i,t}*X_{a_{i,t}}^{s} + h_{t,a_{i,t}} +j_{l_{i,t},1}
$$

<!-- $$  -->
<!-- S_{i,t} \sim dbernoulli(s_{i,t}) -->
<!-- $$ -->

$$
logit(r_{i,t})= A_{a_{i,t}}^{r} + E_{i,t+1}*X_{a_{i,t}}^{r} + h_{t,(a_{i,t}+3)} +j_{l_{i,t+1},2} + k_{i,1}
$$

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- R_{i,t} \sim dbernoulli(r_{i,t}) -->
<!-- $$ -->

|      |   1: R=0    | 2:  R=1      | 3: dead |

| 3: dead  |  0    |  0     |     1      | 

where $p_{1,t}$ and $p_{2,t}$ varied with time sush that:

$$
logit(p_{1,t})= \hat{p}_{1}+ q_{t}
$$
where $ \hat{p}_{1}$ is the average capture for individual in state 1 (R=0) and $q_{t}\sim Normal(0,\sigma^2_{p})$, with $\sigma^2_{p}$ being the temporal variance in capture probability. 


### Number of fledging 

Number of fledgling follows a zero-inflated Poisson distribution. Zero-inflation models can be considered as a mixture of 2 distribution reflecting the probability to have more than 0 (state==2) and the number of fledgling (REF). We can model this has:

$$
F_{i,t} \sim dpoisson(f_{i,t}*R_{i,t})
$$

$R_{i,t}$ is already modeled by the multi-state CMR model, so we only need to additionally model the $f_{i,t}$. Just like the reproductive success and survival, we model it as a function of age, with id and (age|yr) as random effects. 

$$
exp(f_{i,t+1})= A_{a_{i,t}}^{f} + E_{i,t+1}*X_{a_{i,t}}^{f} + h_{t,(a_{i,t}+6)} +j_{l_{i,t},3}+ k_{i,2}
$$

### random effects
random effect for year was age dependent and was taken from a multivariate normal distribution to allow for annual covariance between age-classes and traits (survival reproductive success and number of fledgling). The prior on this distribution was defined using a scaled inverse Wishart prior.

Random effects for farm were additive and were age independent. this was also taken from a multivariate normal distribution to account for correlated response between traits (survival, reproductive success and number of fledgling)

Similarly, the individual random effect were additive and were age independent. this was also taken from a multivariate normal distribution to account for correlated response between traits (reproductive success and number of fledgling)

### model selection 

different candidate models were tested to reflect different effects of environment.

| model |  var | k | WAIC  | delta WAIC |
|:----|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| 1   | age          |   9          |       10945        |  56.2|
| 2   | age*coldSnap |   18          |       10946        | 57.2|
| 3   | age*(temp+prec)|  27           |          10929     | 39.8|
| 4   | age*hosp          |    18         |   10889            | 0|
| 5   | age*AI          |   18          |    10914           |  25.4|
| 6   | age*(AI+hosp)          |   27          |  10912             |  23.0|
| 7   | age*(coldSnap+prec)          |   27          |     10943          |  54.4|
| 8   | Age * (AI * coldSnap * prec) |   63          |  10997             |   108.3|
| 9   | Age * (AI * coldSnap * prec +hosp) |   72          | 11027              |  137.8|


### immigration rates

We estimated 3 immigration rates per year (see life cycle bellow): the immigration of N to the SY class, of SY to ASY and of ASY to ASY. The immigrating individual in the 2 later rates cannot be distinguished. Based on some number from Esther about the proportion of returning females which are SY, we assume that 48 % of arriving ASY where SY the previous year (based on Carle-Pruneau et al. 2021). These numbers of arriving individuals are then divided by the size of marked population alive in the relevant stage the previous year  (including those that are alive, but not captured). 


## demographic analysis

Leslie matrices were constructed using a postbreeding census approach and assuming an offspring sex ratio of 0.5. 
![](graphs/lifeCycle.png)

|   | N  | SY |ASY |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| N |  $s_{1}*r_{1}*f_{1}*0.5$  | $s_{2}*r_{2}*f_{2} *0.5$   | $s_{3}*r_{3}*f_{3} *0.5$ |
| SY| $s_{1} +i_{1}$   | 0  | 0  |
|ASY| 0  |  $s_{2} +i_{2}$  |  $s_{3} +i_{3}$  |

where $s_{1}$ is the survival from nestling to second year, $r_{1}$ is the probability of a nestling to successfully fledge a young next year (a second year)  and $f1$ is the expected number of fledgling for a successful second year; and so forth to the other age classes. lambda sensitivities and elasticities were cacultated using the popbio package in R. Sensitivities and elasticities of each fitness component were decomposed from the demographic transition using the approach by Van Tienderen (2000). These were calculated both for each year of the study (by including the year random effect and mean annual values for environmental variable) and at the population level (by ignoring all random effects).

## variance partitioning of lambda (may not be as pertinent if their is only 1 explanatory variable)

To quantify the relative importance of temporal fluctuation and spatial variation in explaining the variation in fitness of the population, we predicted fitness component for all age classes in a given environment, build appropriate Leslie matrix and calculated lambda. Using a resampling approach, ** to describe if needed** 

# Results

Based on WAIC selection, the best model only included the density of house sparrow as explanatory variable. it affected mostly the ASY, with a significant negative effect on reproductive success and strong tendencies for survial and number of fledgings. 

|trait(age) |  mean|   sd|   cil|   cih|
|:-------------|-----:|----:|-----:|-----:|
|s(N) | -0.09| 0.19| -0.49|  0.26|
|s(SY)  0.11| 0.17| -0.21|  0.44|
|s(ASY) | -0.14| 0.07| -0.28|  0.00|
|r(N) | -0.55| 0.58| -1.77|  0.52|
|r(SY) | -0.43| 0.31| -1.03|  0.18|
|r(ASY) | -0.64| 0.16| -0.97| -0.33|
|f(N) | -0.01| 0.23| -0.50|  0.43|
|f(SY) |  0.01| 0.06| -0.11|  0.13|
|f(ASY) | -0.04| 0.03| -0.11|  0.02|



Based on predicted fitness components, estimated lambda and observed population growth was highly correlated (0.7). Anual variation caused little varaition in the elasticities and sensistivities, with survival of ASY and immigration into that age classe dominating in importance. When using sensitivities we do see that survival of nestling and reproductive success of ASY are also somewhat important.
